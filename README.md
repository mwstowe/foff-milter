## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70 or later
- sendmail or postfix with milter support

**Note:** This milter uses the `indymilter` library (v0.3) which provides a pure Rust milter implementation, so you don't need libmilter development headers.

### Building

```bash
cargo build --release
```

## Configuration

The system uses a modular configuration approach with separate YAML files for different components:
