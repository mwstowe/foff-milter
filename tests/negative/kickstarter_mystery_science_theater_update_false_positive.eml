First, we invite you to uncover so many secrets with The Terror, a film whe=
re a shipwrecked young French soldier bothers an old reclusive Baron, and g=
ets into some Scooby-Doo shenanigans. 2 Movie Moment cards and 2 Riffs will=

or a Dream for pot in the late 1930s. 2 Movie Moment cards and 2 Riffs will=

 best gal, and chill out, man! You're about to see someone's whole life cru=

award-winning film based on the play of the same name where a man with a bi=
g nose is in love with the girl all the fellas are after. 2 Movie Moment ca=
rds and 2 Riffs will be added for the movie to the Deluxe game. You've like=
ly seen the iconic balcony scene adapted across a thousand iterations, so I=
 thought we could educate you monkeys a little with some culture today by s=
howing you the source.=0D

Spotlight: The Wasp Woman=0D
-------------------------=0D
=0D
=0D
=0D
In this film, we have a precursor to what The Substance did by half a centu=
ry and change. A businesswoman is being pushed out of her image-centric com=
pany and abuses fringe medicine to shave off some years. The end result? We=
ll, just look at the Movie Moment card above. The takeaway? I should be mor=
e ok about my encroaching male pattern baldness.=0D
=0D
From the Toy-Cluttered Desk of Dan Stong=0D
----------------------------------------=0D
=0D
When we last left off in our look at design, I was puzzling on how to make =
the gameplay loop a little more dynamic than flip, read, and vote. I rememb=
ered the line =E2=80=9Cand we=E2=80=99ll monitor his mind=E2=80=9D from the=
 theme song and I had an idea to get the Mads back in play and also a way t=
o round the scoring out a bit and get more of the show into the game.=0D
=0D
MST3K has such a visual element to the Host segments and the world surround=
ing the movies and I had been feeling like we were losing that, so I was to=
ying with ways to get more characters featured in the game. That could be t=
hrough tokens, a scoreboard, or standees/trackers. It was hard to justify a=
 scoreboard at first as most party games use cards to track points. It=E2=
=80=99s a proven elegant system and avoids extra setup for a game you shoul=
d be able to bust out quickly.=C2=A0=0D
=0D
But when I was thinking about the Mads (judges) having some higher stakes i=
n their decisions, that line from the theme song came to me again. What if =
players bet on themselves each round, and there was a way for the Mads to g=
et some extra points out of it? Not any pure deduction but a light bonus if=
 you felt the strength behind a choice someone made that lined up well. Thi=
s would make every turn a chance for players to get points, so stakes would=
 be raised and create a new decision point for the players and the Mads.=C2=
=A0=0D
=0D
I played around with values, and 1,3, &amp; 5 seemed to be the most impactf=
ul point values for betting without getting too swingy. We picked different=
 colors and some symbols for each set as a second way for our colorblind fr=
iends to distinguish them. We chose to limit the use of the chips (you only=
 get to use each chip once until you=E2=80=99ve played all three, then get =
them back), so players couldn=E2=80=99t just play 5 every time and give the=
m another decision point on top of their riff choice. How strongly did you =
feel about the card you just played? You wouldn=E2=80=99t lose any points o=
n your =E2=80=9Cbet=E2=80=9D if it didn=E2=80=99t work out, but you=E2=80=
=99d have a little evaluation on the strength of your play you could do to =
net more.=0D
=0D
It seemed to work out. The chance to bet on yourself empowered testers even=
 more to feel like they weren=E2=80=99t just tossing a card in and hoping t=
o get a point, but it was now THE card that would score them 5 points! The =
Mads could get a piece of the action through =E2=80=9Cdata points=E2=80=9D =
they would secure by =E2=80=9Cmonitoring the minds=E2=80=9D of the players =
when they selected the player who was revealed to have a larger payday on w=
inning the hand. When a Riff felt extremely relevant to an image, the Mads =
might be able to key into that and assume the players also bet higher. When=
 a player bet 5, the Mads would get 2 points, and when a player bet 3, the =
Mads would get 1 point. The change to non-static scoring helped open the pl=
aying field up a bit by allowing for some more dynamic score spreads.=C2=A0=
 The highs were higher and the lows were lower but rounds were still just a=
s fast. Thematically, the test subjects were always putting out their best =
and the Mads were conducting this experiment on their reactions to the film=
 so it felt like a good mesh mechanically too.=C2=A0=0D
=0D
This variable point system also felt like the justification I needed for mo=
re components. The scoreboard joined with standees and the betting tokens a=
nd the whole thing started to look more like MST3K. But there were two more=
 pieces we were still trying to see were viable before we felt this would b=
e something fans would want.=0D
=0D

UNLOCKED STRETCH GOALS=0D
----------------------=0D
=0D
Three more stretch goals, just like that! Thanks for the amazing support.=0D
=0D
First, we invite you to uncover so many secrets with *The Terror*, a film w=
here a shipwrecked young French soldier bothers an old reclusive Baron, and=
 gets into some Scooby-Doo shenanigans. 2 Movie Moment cards and 2 Riffs wi=
ll be added for the movie to the Deluxe game. Enjoy the deals with the Devi=
l, hauntings, and floating boulders!=0D
=0D
For our next experiment, we invite you to learn the perils of "the devil's =
lettuce" with *Reefer Madness*, a film that could be considered the *Requie=
m for a Dream* for pot in the late 1930s. 2 Movie Moment cards and 2 Riffs =
will be added for the movie to the Deluxe game. Dig that crazy piano, grab =
your best gal, and chill out, man! You're about to see someone's whole life=
 crumble around them in this sensationalist schlock.=0D
=0D
Last but not least, we invite you to get a whiff of *Cyrano de Bergerac*, a=
n award-winning film based on the play of the same name where a man with a =
big nose is in love with the girl all the fellas are after. 2 Movie Moment =
cards and 2 Riffs will be added for the movie to the Deluxe game. You've li=
kely seen the iconic balcony scene adapted across a thousand iterations, so=
 I thought we could educate you monkeys a little with some culture today by=
 showing you the source.=0D
=0D
Spotlight: *The Wasp Woman*=0D
---------------------------=0D
=0D
In this film, we have a precursor to what *The Substance*did by half a cent=
ury and change. A businesswoman is being pushed out of her image-centric co=
mpany and abuses fringe medicine to shave off some years. The end result? W=
ell, just look at the Movie Moment card above. The takeaway? I should be mo=
re ok about my encroaching male pattern baldness.=0D
=0D
From the Toy-Cluttered Desk of Dan Stong=0D
----------------------------------------=0D
=0D
When we last left off in our look at design, I was puzzling on how to make =
the gameplay loop a little more dynamic than flip, read, and vote. I rememb=
ered the line =E2=80=9Cand we=E2=80=99ll monitor his mind=E2=80=9D from the=
 theme song and I had an idea to get the Mads back in play and also a way t=
o round the scoring out a bit and get more of the show into the game.=0D
=0D
MST3K has such a visual element to the Host segments and the world surround=
ing the movies and I had been feeling like we were losing that, so I was to=
ying with ways to get more characters featured in the game. That could be t=
hrough tokens, a scoreboard, or standees/trackers. It was hard to justify a=
 scoreboard at first as most party games use cards to track points. It=E2=
=80=99s a proven elegant system and avoids extra setup for a game you shoul=
d be able to bust out quickly.=0D
=0D
But when I was thinking about the Mads (judges) having some higher stakes i=
n their decisions, that line from the theme song came to me again. What if =
players bet on themselves each round, and there was a way for the Mads to g=
et some extra points out of it? Not any pure deduction but a light bonus if=
 you felt the strength behind a choice someone made that lined up well. Thi=
s would make every turn a chance for players to get points, so stakes would=
 be raised and create a new decision point for the players and the Mads.=0D
=0D
I played around with values, and 1,3, &amp;amp; 5 seemed to be the most imp=
actful point values for betting without getting too swingy. We picked diffe=
rent colors and some symbols for each set as a second way for our colorblin=
d friends to distinguish them. We chose to limit the use of the chips (you =
only get to use each chip once until you=E2=80=99ve played all three, then =
get them back), so players couldn=E2=80=99t just play 5 every time and give=
 them another decision point on top of their riff choice. How strongly did =
you feel about the card you just played? You wouldn=E2=80=99t lose any poin=
ts on your =E2=80=9Cbet=E2=80=9D if it didn=E2=80=99t work out, but you=E2=
=80=99d have a little evaluation on the strength of your play you could do =
to net more.=0D
=0D
It seemed to work out. The chance to bet on yourself empowered testers even=
 more to feel like they weren=E2=80=99t just tossing a card in and hoping t=
o get a point, but it was now THE card that would score them 5 points! The =
Mads could get a piece of the action through =E2=80=9Cdata points=E2=80=9D =
they would secure by =E2=80=9Cmonitoring the minds=E2=80=9D of the players =
when they selected the player who was revealed to have a larger payday on w=
inning the hand. When a Riff felt extremely relevant to an image, the Mads =
might be able to key into that and assume the players also bet higher. When=
 a player bet 5, the Mads would get 2 points, and when a player bet 3, the =
Mads would get 1 point. The change to non-static scoring helped open the pl=
aying field up a bit by allowing for some more dynamic score spreads. The h=
ighs were higher and the lows were lower but rounds were still just as fast=
. Thematically, the test subjects were always putting out their best and th=
e Mads were conducting this experiment on their reactions to the film so it=
 felt like a good mesh mechanically too.=0D
=0D
This variable point system also felt like the justification I needed for mo=
re components. The scoreboard joined with standees and the betting tokens a=
nd the whole thing started to look more like MST3K. But there were two more=
 pieces we were still trying to see were viable before we felt this would b=
e something fans would want.=0D
=0D
But more on that later=E2=80=A6=0D

<p style=3D"line-height: 1.5;"><br>In this film, we have a precursor to wha=
t <em>The Substance </em>did by half a century and change. A businesswoman =
is being pushed out of her image-centric company and abuses fringe medicine=
 to shave off some years. The end result? Well, just look at the Movie Mome=
nt card above. The takeaway? I should be more ok about my encroaching male =
pattern baldness.</p>=0D

><strong>From the Toy-Cluttered Desk of Dan Stong</strong></h3>=0D
<p style=3D"line-height: 1.5;">When we last left off in our look at design,=
 I was puzzling on how to make the gameplay loop a little more dynamic than=
 flip, read, and vote. I remembered the line =E2=80=9Cand we=E2=80=99ll mon=
itor his mind=E2=80=9D from the theme song and I had an idea to get the Mad=
s back in play and also a way to round the scoring out a bit and get more o=
f the show into the game.</p>=0D
<p style=3D"line-height: 1.5;">MST3K has such a visual element to the Host =
segments and the world surrounding the movies and I had been feeling like w=
e were losing that, so I was toying with ways to get more characters featur=
ed in the game. That could be through tokens, a scoreboard, or standees/tra=
ckers. It was hard to justify a scoreboard at first as most party games use=
 cards to track points. It=E2=80=99s a proven elegant system and avoids ext=
ra setup for a game you should be able to bust out quickly.=C2=A0</p>=0D
<p style=3D"line-height: 1.5;">But when I was thinking about the Mads (judg=
es) having some higher stakes in their decisions, that line from the theme =
song came to me again. What if players bet on themselves each round, and th=
ere was a way for the Mads to get some extra points out of it? Not any pure=
 deduction but a light bonus if you felt the strength behind a choice someo=
ne made that lined up well. This would make every turn a chance for players=
 to get points, so stakes would be raised and create a new decision point f=
or the players and the Mads.=C2=A0</p>=0D
<p style=3D"line-height: 1.5;">I played around with values, and 1,3, &amp; =
5 seemed to be the most impactful point values for betting without getting =
too swingy. We picked different colors and some symbols for each set as a s=
econd way for our colorblind friends to distinguish them. We chose to limit=
 the use of the chips (you only get to use each chip once until you=E2=80=
=99ve played all three, then get them back), so players couldn=E2=80=99t ju=
st play 5 every time and give them another decision point on top of their r=
iff choice. How strongly did you feel about the card you just played? You w=
ouldn=E2=80=99t lose any points on your =E2=80=9Cbet=E2=80=9D if it didn=E2=
=80=99t work out, but you=E2=80=99d have a little evaluation on the strengt=
h of your play you could do to net more.</p>=0D
<p style=3D"line-height: 1.5;">It seemed to work out. The chance to bet on =
yourself empowered testers even more to feel like they weren=E2=80=99t just=
 tossing a card in and hoping to get a point, but it was now THE card that =
would score them 5 points! The Mads could get a piece of the action through=
 =E2=80=9Cdata points=E2=80=9D they would secure by =E2=80=9Cmonitoring the=
 minds=E2=80=9D of the players when they selected the player who was reveal=
ed to have a larger payday on winning the hand. When a Riff felt extremely =
relevant to an image, the Mads might be able to key into that and assume th=
e players also bet higher. When a player bet 5, the Mads would get 2 points=
, and when a player bet 3, the Mads would get 1 point. The change to non-st=
atic scoring helped open the playing field up a bit by allowing for some mo=
re dynamic score spreads.=C2=A0 The highs were higher and the lows were low=
er but rounds were still just as fast. Thematically, the test subjects were=
 always putting out their best and the Mads were conducting this experiment=
 on their reactions to the film so it felt like a good mesh mechanically to=
o.=C2=A0</p>=0D
<p style=3D"line-height: 1.5;">This variable point system also felt like th=
e justification I needed for more components. The scoreboard joined with st=
andees and the betting tokens and the whole thing started to look more like=
 MST3K. But there were two more pieces we were still trying to see were via=
ble before we felt this would be something fans would want.</p>=0D
