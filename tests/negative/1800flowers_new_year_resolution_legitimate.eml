The days after Christmas and Hanukkah don’t feel like the rest of the year. The big moments have passed, but the kids are still home, work has slowed, and the house feels a little fuller than usual. Outside, it’s dark early, and there’s less pressure to be anywhere in a hurry.
 


This week is an 
https://click.pulse.celebrations.com/?qs=fe35b450168a183d1d4bd4eb63c030ed67685735ca5ae6a4d3b044fe2d76f82dc2ba39050aa4578effc6cf4fc709a80252b81836440875d26f06f94ba0234bed 
in-between moment . It’s easy to let it slip by if you’re not paying attention. I like to think of these days as a gift of extra time, where nothing’s scheduled and nothing feels urgent. There’s just time to be together.


This period invites reflection. Memories from the past year surface, along with questions about the one ahead. Did I spend my time the way I wanted to? What mattered more than I expected? What do I want to carry forward when life picks up speed again?


Those questions often lead to John Doe’s resolutions and the inevitable 
https://click.pulse.celebrations.com/?qs=fe35b450168a183dc08e94fe1ddfd0d28281258debf6e9e3e40eef1602a65833adfc68b8f95b995318996dbdac7db66ad9ff6dcc8bc08900ebfae07bb5e8b675 
challenge of keeping them  once January gives way to February and beyond. I’ve struggled with that myself. Over the years, I’ve found a few ways to stay on track, and I’d like to share them here.




 

Why resolutions so often fail


By now, most of us know how this story goes. We begin the year with ambitious resolutions, fueled by optimism and good intentions. “This will be the year I get in shape, eat better, save more money.” Sound familiar? Within weeks — sometimes days — many of those promises 
https://click.pulse.celebrations.com/?qs=fe35b450168a183da112c5d49f476e89e056b26ed9e1251649e017cf3ea100657a44dcf2bde032782294264842cce3d355d48242772748ce81f6bc8b00a01912 
slip away . The cycle 
https://click.pulse.celebrations.com/?qs=fe35b450168a183d7f2e02f7e5700da203e6c60eeece21b234ae2ed309d8d190b23f1e89e277367cd0fc94e009d9337357ce63d467d26fb8266b1ae71d1670d0 
repeats itself  year after year.


It’s tempting to blame a lack of discipline or willpower, but I don’t think that’s the whole story. More often than not, the problem isn’t a lack of effort; it’s how we frame the resolution from the very beginning.


We tend to 
https://click.pulse.celebrations.com/?qs=fe35b450168a183d782c76fa82c3b62e933c00592baf82092f01ae911f61b6d91193bf37ffa171f1bfc3c630d7bd04ef9489065be1070fdf95dc870b3b316bc5 
ask too much  of ourselves, too quickly. We aim for sweeping change instead of manageable steps. The goals are big, rigid, and disconnected from the realities of daily life. When progress doesn’t show up immediately, discouragement sets in.


A better approach is to 
https://click.pulse.celebrations.com/?qs=fe35b450168a183d1289d4b1ab02160c499030bcf5e5ebe70bf1d8651950b0b61fe7f7643cd11f485710ff5171da77f8f443eff8e4d79fe8192c5c76ed101acd 
start small . Break a big challenge into more manageable pieces. If the goal is better health, begin with a short daily walk. If it’s saving money, start by setting aside a modest amount each week. These steps may feel simple, but that’s the point.


Relationship resolutions


If you’re looking for a resolution that delivers the greatest return, consider investing in your relationships. Few choices offer more impact for so little effort. Both research and experience point to the same conclusion: 
https://click.pulse.celebrations.com/?qs=fe35b450168a183dfcfa9b58286e17bdef1efcbb8dcaf2eb2e88cbf1e609649238bc9d874efa2045b799072ecd6a6922edfc8abc480b194c5caf53a4281cb9bf 
Strong relationships sit at the center of a healthy, fulfilling life .
 


As I’ve written in many John Doe letters, scientists have found that strong social ties reduce stress, 
https://click.pulse.celebrations.com/?qs=fe35b450168a183d1cc0d0577e6463d064d8bafa4efebbb524ae7d7b5bbac2067dcbd169f196f6d1589dcc02484647d6248a38907eee4d57893176ceb98287b0 
improve physical and mental health , and protect us against loneliness. They also support every other goal we care about, from career growth to emotional resilience.
 


And yet, despite knowing all of this, many of us feel more disconnected than ever. Life gets busy, responsibilities stack up, and time moves faster than we expect. Most relationships don’t end with a blowup or a falling out. Instead, they 
https://click.pulse.celebrations.com/?qs=fe35b450168a183de5fba27b031046f7d0a8fd00e48489c907d41f8691dae65458f9c21b1edb438bac2a4cd33a8d167dabcf428c75731608f1765fb7bb885a36 
fade quietly  when we stop tending to them.
 


That’s why choosing to focus on relationships makes for a strong foundational resolution. When our connections are strong, everything else feels more manageable.




https://click.pulse.celebrations.com/?qs=fe35b450168a183dd488e63c06648f6b2b0bf6ca418a69c7539f39074f6a2baffb6c4c7e819e1ed230b1fff7f7f68115987f781aa7632024aa72de411dfa85e5 

A personal experience


Years ago, during an especially demanding stretch of my life, I realized that good intentions weren’t enough. I cared deeply about the people in my life, but that care wasn’t translating into consistent action.


John Doe, I decided to make a change. I built a simple system to help myself stay in touch on a regular basis. Each day, I reached out to one person. Sometimes it was a quick phone call. Other times, a short note or message. 


What surprised me was how effective my “connectivity calendar” became. The effort was small, and the impact was immediate: Conversations deepened, relationships strengthened, and I felt back on track with the people who mattered most.




An invitation to think differently


As the new year begins, I hope you take time to reflect on all the relationships you have and want to have. As my friend 
https://click.pulse.celebrations.com/?qs=fe35b450168a183d0a9f3d0e3785bd1271852d14d05d6e39631a68faa3a647f6ac5b2ccea86cedf91017bd35b3e85650e2520d5113ad78ba3e701348e4310674 
Dr. George S. Everly, Jr. , says: “Nurture the relationships you have, rekindle the relationships you’ve lost, and create the relationships you wish you had.”


It’s a great John Doe’s resolution — and one that’s simple enough that you won’t be abandoning it after a few weeks. Don’t start with a sweeping goal; start with a person who will appreciate hearing from you.
 


That single act of connection can become a habit. And that habit can quietly shape the year ahead in ways no other resolution ever could.


 


John Doe Year!

Dr. John Doe , a Harvard lecturer focused on team health, connection, and performance.
 


The conversation cuts through the noise around artificial intelligence to focus on what actually matters. Sergio and Bobbi talk about how AI is changing the way we create and lead, the role of craft in an era of rapid automation, and why human connection remains the foundation of great teams and great work.
 


Along the way, we explore creativity as a source of exponential impact and the future of work as something shaped by entirely new capabilities we’re just beginning to understand. It’s a candid, forward-looking discussion about change, responsibility, and opportunity.
 


If you’re thinking about how to lead, create, and build meaningful connections in a fast-moving world, this episode offers both clarity and optimism about what comes next.




 



What’s your resolution strategy?


As the new year begins, I’d love to hear how you’re thinking about the months ahead. What’s one resolution you’re focusing on, or a small step you’re taking as you start the year? And how are you planning to stay with it as January gives way to the rest of the year?
 


I’ll be gathering the community’s reflections for a special John Doe letter in 2026. These notes are always thoughtful and inspiring, and I’m looking forward to sharing your stories with other readers in the year ahead.
 


As a thank-you, I’ll select five entries at random to receive a gift from the 1-800-Flowers.com family of brands — something to help you start the year on a good note.

It’s also a great opportunity to begin something you might

flowers  or soft lighting to create a sense of occasion.


However you choose to celebrate, the intention is the same: to welcome the new year feeling present and connected. Sometimes, staying in is exactly the right way to begin.

The big moments have passed, but the kids are still home, work has slowed, and the house feels a little fuller than usual. Outside, it’s dark early, and there’s less pressure to be anywhere in a hurry.

It’s easy to let it slip by if you’re not paying attention. I like to think of these days as a gift of extra time, where nothing’s scheduled and nothing feels urgent. There’s just time to be together.<br><br>
This period invites reflection. Memories from the past year surface, along with questions about the one ahead. Did I spend my time the way I wanted to? What mattered more than I expected? What do I want to carry forward when life picks up speed again?<br><br>
Those questions often lead to John Doe’s resolutions and the inevitable <a  style="color:#000000;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;margin:0 !important;padding:0 !important;line-height:100% !important;mso-line-height-rule:exactly !important;" href="https://click.pulse.celebrations.com/?qs=5c733619924fadce31440b07496ae1369905d4b6f0e2bfec8742fa29ae8400f77cc228420d86ec1eaaffe5af51b120092131e8403ee9a2e20b536427230882a8">challenge of keeping them</a> once January gives way to February and beyond.

By now, most of us know how this story goes. We begin the year with ambitious resolutions, fueled by optimism and good intentions. “This will be the year I get in shape, eat better, save more money.” Sound familiar? Within weeks — sometimes days — many of those promises <a  style="color:#000000;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;margin:0 !important;padding:0 !important;line-height:100% !important;mso-line-height-rule:exactly !important;" href="https://click.pulse.celebrations.com/?qs=5c733619924fadce21c619b066f4a1453437269d958fb663b34136d8afc084ba1b0ff795e823951043cd4753652a3db704852e73d1d1982bb40067b011e740fc">slip away</a>. The cycle 
<a  style="color:#000000;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;margin:0 !important;padding:0 !important;line-height:100% !important;mso-line-height-rule:exactly !important;" href="https://click.pulse.celebrations.com/?qs=5c733619924fadce2eef77e66950e05f476d43dca0ac5c95f3b38648a036733aaeb508ec7479a3598607ef66d704ccd38b16fad11c7880f775abf4760a6648ed">repeats itself
</a> year after year.<br><br>
It’s tempting to blame a lack of discipline or willpower, but I don’t think that’s the whole story. More often than not, the problem isn’t a lack of effort; it’s how we frame the resolution from the very beginning.<br><br>
We tend to <a  style="color:#000000;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;margin:0 !important;padding:0 !important;line-height:100% !important;mso-line-height-rule:exactly !important;" href="https://click.pulse.celebrations.com/?qs=5c733619924fadcef056662d6ebe009a612608e8309393042dc80da2e9ac0464fffc3a4997d2d11fe1b99270a0b4c7aa7a99e3313234c680659f54e9bf66eaec">ask too much</a> of ourselves, too quickly. We aim for sweeping change instead of manageable steps. The goals are big, rigid, and disconnected from the realities of daily life. When progress doesn’t show up immediately, discouragement sets in.<br><br>
A better approach is to <a  style="color:#000000;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;margin:0 !important;padding:0 !important;line-height:100% !important;mso-line-height-rule:exactly !important;" href="https://click.pulse.celebrations.com/?qs=5c733619924fadce5df5fad20d6a522172b8d4171724ce8906590ee7ffaab67923b6c4ceeb4a1942d71e73caa8134b262462ce419f6a9d134ce8ba620e8f0bd3">start small</a>. Break a big challenge into more manageable pieces. If the goal is better health, begin with a short daily walk. If it’s saving money, start by setting aside a modest amount each week. These steps may feel simple, but that’s the point.

If you’re looking for a resolution that delivers the greatest return, consider investing in your relationships. Few choices offer more impact for so little effort. Both research and experience point to the same conclusion: <a  style="color:#000000;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;margin:0 !important;padding:0 !important;line-height:100% !important;mso-line-height-rule:exactly !important;" href="https://click.pulse.celebrations.com/?qs=5c733619924fadce7f77413f2ff1eac31fe6ed8f28a99feb10b17a21d7655b011185aab6e8d79423119eba0679238fef9a7c6224dcab8046dcb23ac054fcbc6c">Strong relationships sit at the center of a healthy, fulfilling life</a>.
    <br><br>
As I’ve written in many <i>John Doe</i> letters, scientists have found that strong social ties reduce stress, <a  style="color:#000000;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;margin:0 !important;padding:0 !important;line-height:100% !important;mso-line-height-rule:exactly !important;" href="https://click.pulse.celebrations.com/?qs=5c733619924fadce5da429171b27bf17d36e0568e8bdd7035a8a9ead00abad14495264dd247952b74452c39eaeb4957f377e0750c01ef5d5b7521a9fb5c2fb5e">improve physical and mental health</a>, and protect us against loneliness. They also support every other goal we care about, from career growth to emotional resilience.
    <br><br>
And yet, despite knowing all of this, many of us feel more disconnected than ever. Life gets busy, responsibilities stack up, and time moves faster than we expect. Most relationships don’t end with a blowup or a falling out. Instead, they <a  style="color:#000000;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;margin:0 !important;padding:0 !important;line-height:100% !important;mso-line-height-rule:exactly !important;" href="https://click.pulse.celebrations.com/?qs=5c733619924fadcee3cd715512fbd55f8a17a79cd9ba1b2ddfaaba4d8565a1953dad3d16ef0adf0e2083c064aa6ec772e976ef290bfe7abb843cf552fe8135cd">fade quietly</a> when we stop tending to them.
    <br><br>
That’s why choosing to focus on relationships makes for a strong foundational resolution. When our connections are strong, everything else feels more manageable.

Years ago, during an especially demanding stretch of my life, I realized that good intentions weren’t enough. I cared deeply about the people in my life, but that care wasn’t translating into consistent action.<br><br>
John Doe, I decided to make a change. I built a simple system to help myself stay in touch on a regular basis. Each day, I reached out to one person. Sometimes it was a quick phone call. Other times, a short note or message. <br><br>
What surprised me was how effective my “connectivity calendar” became. The effort was small, and the impact was immediate: Conversations deepened, relationships strengthened, and I felt back on track with the people who mattered most.

As the new year begins, I hope you take time to reflect on all the relationships you have and want to have. As my friend <a  style="color:#000000;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;margin:0 !important;padding:0 !important;line-height:100% !important;mso-line-height-rule:exactly !important;" href="https://click.pulse.celebrations.com/?qs=5c733619924fadce28b6f87682520fbd7cf92f470e78ff817a15bfd8af8dfbfb1ef3727648ef640fe78555a2767a80d4e0b84ed4f48bbafc932370dd0fb1befa">Dr. George S. Everly, Jr.</a>, says: “Nurture the relationships you have, rekindle the relationships you’ve lost, and create the relationships you wish you had.”<br><br>
It’s a great John Doe’s resolution — and one that’s simple enough that you won’t be abandoning it after a few weeks. Don’t start with a sweeping goal; start with a person who will appreciate hearing from you.
    <br><br>
That single act of connection can become a habit. And that habit can quietly shape the year ahead in ways no other resolution ever could.


    <br><br>
John Doe Year!

    <br><br>
The conversation cuts through the noise around artificial intelligence to focus on what actually matters. Sergio and Bobbi talk about how AI is changing the way we create and lead, the role of craft in an era of rapid automation, and why human connection remains the foundation of great teams and great work.
    <br><br>
Along the way, we explore creativity as a source of exponential impact and the future of work as something shaped by entirely new capabilities we’re just beginning to understand. It’s a candid, forward-looking discussion about change, responsibility, and opportunity.
    <br><br>
If you’re thinking about how to lead, create, and build meaningful connections in a fast-moving world, this episode offers both clarity and optimism about what comes next.

As the new year begins, I’d love to hear how you’re thinking about the months ahead. What’s one resolution you’re focusing on, or a small step you’re taking as you start the year? And how are you planning to stay with it as January gives way to the rest of the year?
    <br><br>
I’ll be gathering the community’s reflections for a special <i>John Doe</i> letter in 2026. These notes are always thoughtful and inspiring, and I’m looking forward to sharing your stories with other readers in the year ahead.
    <br><br>
As a thank-you, I’ll select five entries at random to receive a gift from the 1-800-Flowers.com family of brands — something to help you start the year on a good note.

Some of the most memorable celebrations happen at home, shaped by a bit of intention and shared with the people who matter most.<br><br>
My advice is to approach it the way you would any thoughtful gathering. Send an invite, set a tone with a dress code — pajamas or black tie both work! — and decide on one or two simple moments that give the evening shape, whether that’s a favorite game, a movie everyone loves, or an adult beverage reserved for midnight.<br><br>
It’s also a great opportunity to begin something you might <a  style="color:#000000;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;margin:0 !important;padding:0 !important;line-height:100% !important;mso-line-height-rule:exactly !important;" href="https://click.pulse.celebrations.com/?qs=5c733619924fadce05864d924ed2d4d6f2438da4fe38cf4e889f7809c28daac1d8f3c4513130c2d2d934b5797724e0424b248beb73d3de76236dc7f478d0cc57">carry forward</a>. A photo taken each year, a shared toast, or a small ritual can turn an ordinary night into a tradition that’s uniquely yours.<br><br>
Keep the food uncomplicated so the focus stays on being together. Order in, light a few candles, and add <a  style="color:#000000;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;margin:0 !important;padding:0 !important;line-height:100% !important;mso-line-height-rule:exactly !important;" href="https://click.pulse.celebrations.com/?qs=5c733619924fadce6301a394076008995fc0bc1cd1bd3cffe545297198704718d6f5151c45c2a14f6cd9a0fa10235f2090dcf2c1899d567f2d38b13de2e3c2f2">flowers</a> or soft lighting to create a sense of occasion.<br><br>
However you choose to celebrate, the intention is the same: to welcome the new year feeling present and connected. Sometimes, staying in is exactly the right way to begin.
