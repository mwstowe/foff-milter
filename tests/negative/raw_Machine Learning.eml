# Maker Faire: Curious minds and human connection=20

by Gillian Mutti, Maker Faire Director

If you=E2=80=99ve wandered through the creative chaos of a Maker Faire, you=
 know it=E2=80=99s more than a showcase of gadgets. Beyond the spectacle li=
es the secret ingredient: human connection. Most projects on display don=E2=
=80=99t begin on a workbench =E2=80=94 they spark in a conversation between=
 curious minds from wildly different backgrounds.

At this year=E2=80=99s Maker Faire Bay Area, nestled in the Storehouse, att=
endees gathered around the first public prototype from NestWorks. It buzzed=
 with intrigue, drawing feedback that confirmed a critical insight: the com=
pany=E2=80=99s costly bottleneck =E2=80=94 over a million dollars annually =
spent on outsourced, custom-machined parts =E2=80=94 was a problem shared b=
y many.

This wasn=E2=80=99t a noisy industrial relic. It was a quiet, self-containe=
d, third-generation proof-of-concept: an =E2=80=9Caccessible factory in a b=
ox=E2=80=9D designed to bring professional-grade machining in metal, compos=
ites, and plastics to makers everywhere. The goal? To slash cost and time w=
hile unlocking a new tier of rapid prototyping. Imagine industrial CNC mach=
ining as accessible and compact as a desktop 3D printer.

Across the venue, creator Scotty Allen of _Strange Parts_ headlined the Fou=
ndry Stage =E2=80=94 yet he still found time to explore. He connected with =
Joey Song from Elephant Robotics and Henry Lin from NestWorks, sparking a c=
ollaboration. Months later, Scotty visited their headquarters to trace the =
origins of their necessity-driven innovation. His deep dive followed their =
journey through the complexities of traditional CAM software, their mission=
 to make CNC as intuitive as 3D printing, and the monumental challenge of b=
uilding a professional machine tool from scratch.

youtu.be/NZs8PP6lG9k?si=3DWV0UbkG5CXQABY_2)

So next time you=E2=80=99re at Maker Faire, look beyond the projects to the=
 _people_. Ask questions. Share your =E2=80=9Ccrazy=E2=80=9D ideas. The per=
son you meet might not just help with your current project =E2=80=94 they c=
ould become a collaborator on your next startup, a beta tester for your bui=
ld, or the inspiration that reshapes your work entirely.

We come to Maker Faire to see what people build. We stay for the connection=
s we make.
Maybe the most important thing you=E2=80=99ll ever make here might just be =
the connection that changes how _everyone_ makes things.

Check out the wildly successful [Kickstarter campaign for the C500](https:/=
/www.kickstarter.com/projects/959480926/nestworks-c500-next-gen-smartest-cn=
c-with-industrial-power/description?category_id=3D335&ref=3Ddiscovery&total=
_hits=3D659598), which has raised almost $8M with six days still to go!=20

# A high school visit

In September before Maker Faire Bay Area, Henry Lin of NestWorks came to vi=
sit the Academy of Innovative Arts, a new public high school in Forestville=
, CA that I have been involved with. He met with students and teachers in t=
he makerspace. He was joined by Rebecca Jiang and Rockets Xia of DFRobot an=
d the Mushroom Cloud Makerspace in Shanghai who demoed the Unihiker K10 and=
 the LattePanda. One of the questions that I asked the three of them was wh=
at high school was like in China =E2=80=94 what would be different?

Henry shared his experience of both Chinese and American high schools. He w=
ent to high school for several years in Maine and enjoyed it. Rebecca talke=
d about the state test that all students take after eighth grade and how on=
ly students in the top 50% go on to high school. She talked about how many =
students in China live in rural areas and their parents may go into the cit=
y for work and so the students stay with grandparents or live in dormitorie=
s. She added that if you tested in the top 1 or 2 percent, your life and th=
e life of your family and even your village would be completely different.=20

Henry talked about how software would make the new CNC C500 easier to use f=
or more people. I thought it was great for the students to learn about peop=
le who are building machines, not just using machines.

# _Computer Engineering for Babies_

by Kevin Toyama, Books Editor

The best gifts are those that are not just cool, but _meaningful_ to the re=
cipient =E2=80=94 where it=E2=80=99s clear that you put a little thought in=
to it. I bought a copy of _Computer Engineering for Babies_ from the Maker =
Shed for [_Robotic Arms_](https://www.makershed.com/collections/make-books-=
print/products/make-robotic-arms) author and new dad Matt Eaton. It=E2=80=
=99s not a book that we published (jealous!), but I thought it would be a f=
un baby gift for a maker. He loved it, and sent me this picture of him and =
his budding engineer.

# Paper Inventions

This week, I hosted a livestream with author Kathy Ceceri.  Make: has publi=
shed a second edition of her book, _[Paper Inventions](https://www.makershe=
d.com/products/make-paper-inventions-2nd-edition)_. Kathy is the author of =
over a dozen books for kids featuring hands-on STEAM activities. (More at _=
[kathyceceri.com](https://kathyceceri.com)_). Kathy and I were joined by Ji=
e Qi, a self-described =E2=80=9Cpaper nerd=E2=80=9D and co-founder and CEO =
of _[Chibitronics](https://chibitronics.com/)_. She lives in St. Petersburg=
, FL. We were also joined by Angii De La Cruz who is the Lead Instructor at=
 the Thinqubator (the children=E2=80=99s makerspace at the _[Tech Valley Ce=
nter of Gravity](https://www.tvcog.net/)_ in Troy, NY.
