Happy Birthday Michael.  You are a wonderful person and I love you.

I vividly remember a night - over a half century ago - when I was =
sweating in active labor as a blizzard roared outside.  At the car, your =
father cleared a small circle on the driver=E2=80=99s side of the car =
(only) and we got in, before the heat warmed the car up, and me, unable =
to see through the snow on the passenger side for the entire trip.  I =
shivered and gasped the whole agonizing trip.  The night was dark and =
swirling with whirlwinds of snowflakes. And deadly quiet.

We slid and rolled through an eerily white and silent landscape.  We =
could hear ice slapping the windshield, but there was no traffic - and =
no tracks from other cars to guide us.  Your father drove maddeningly =
slowly and I was anxious and so afraid I would deliver my baby in the =
car.  When we finally reached the hospital, I staggered into the =
hospital and someone rushed me into a room and warmed me up.  At that =
time, I assumed your father was parking the car, but I didn=E2=80=99t =
see him again until the next day, November 11, 12 hours after you were =
born.  The doctor said you were the biggest baby he had delivered in =
long time. =20

He delivered?  Well, he helped, but it was just you and me and I was =
grateful when you arrived at exactly 8:00 am.

Also, on November 11, I am reminded of your grandfather Martin, serving =
in the Coast Guard, which was called up under the Navy in World War II.  =
Martin was on a Navy ship sent to the Bikini atoll in the Marshall =
Islands to document the effects of Atomic Bomb test explosions.  He had =
an album of photographs showing the explosive clouds over the ocean and =
views of the nearby islands.  In the archive of family photographs you =
can see Martin and his buddy in swimsuits on the beach on Bikini with =
palm trees waving in the background.  I believe that the fallout from =
the Atomic Bomb, which at that time was unknown, affected granddaddy=E2=80=
=99s health and shortened his life.  I salute him on this Veterans=E2=80=99=
 Day.

Love, Mom=
