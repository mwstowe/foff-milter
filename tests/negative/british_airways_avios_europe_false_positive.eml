	1.

	2. 
The Statement Credit will post to the Cardmember&rsquo;s Card account within 45 days of the eligible Reward Flight booking being ticketed and payment received and will appear on the Cardmember&rsquo;s monthly Card billing statement within 1-2 billing cycles. Cardmembers are responsible for payment of all charges until the Statement Credit posts to their account.

	3. 
Cardmembers will receive a US $100 Statement Credit per Reward Flight booking in economy (World Traveller) or premium economy (World Traveller Plus); or a US $200 Statement Credit for all other Reward Flight bookings in business (Club World) and First.
	4. 
Cardmembers will be eligible to receive no more than three (3) Statement Credits for three (3) individual bookings of up to US $200 in any single calendar year, totalling no more than US $600 in Statement Credits per calendar year.

	8.
