Good morning everyone — I wanted to share that the new cedar planter kits arrived in the warehouse over the weekend. The finish looks better than the samples and the hardware packs are clearly labeled. Could you review the layout ideas for the front entrance display and let me know which version you prefer by this afternoon

Thanks Jordan for the update — I walked through the pallets earlier and everything appears organized. My suggestion is to feature the taller planters near the main aisle with the compact sets closer to the seed racks. If that sounds reasonable, I’ll coordinate with the team to start staging after lunch and share quick photos.

I agree with Riley’s approach and would also add a small sign highlighting the cedar material near the entrance. Once the display is in place, please send me the final layout notes so I can update the store map and make sure the weekend crew can easily maintain the setup.

Appreciate the quick responses — let’s move forward with that arrangement. I’ll stop by during staging to confirm placement and take a few reference photos. After everything is finalized, I’ll compile a short summary so we can reuse the layout ideas for other locations later this season.
