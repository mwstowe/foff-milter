er vascular system of the starfish is a hydraulic system made up of a network of fluid-filled canals and is concerned with locomotion, adhesion, food manipulation and gas exchange. Water enters the system through the madreporite, a porous, often conspicuous, sieve-like ossicle on the aboral surface. It is linked through a calcareous-lined canal called the stone canal, to a ring canal around the mouth opening. A set of radial canals branch off from the ring canal; one radial canal runs along the ambulacral groove in each arm. There are short lateral canals branching off alternately to either side of the radial canal, each ending in an ampulla. These bulb-shaped organs are joined to tube feet (podia) on the exterior of the animal by short linking canals that pass through ossicles in the ambulacral groove. There are usually two rows of tube feet but in some species, the lateral canals are alternately long and short and there appear to be four rows. The interior of the whole can!
 al system is lined with cilia.

Water is pushed into the tube face when longitudinal muscles in the ampullae contract, and shut the valves in the lateral canals. This causes the tube feet to stretch and touch the substrate. Although the tube feet resemble suction cups in appearance, the gripping action is a function of adhesive chemicals rather than suction. Other chemicals and relaxation of the ampullae allow for release from the substrate. The tube feet latch on to surfaces and move in a wave, with one arm section attaching to the surface as another releases. To expose the sensory tube feet and the eyespot to external stimuli, some starfish turn up the tips of their arms while moving.

Having descended from bilateral organisms, starfish may move in a bilateral fashion, particularly when hunting or threatened. When crawling, certain arms act as the leading arms, while others trail behind. When a starfish finds itself upside down, two adjacent arms and an opposite arm press against the ground to lift up the two remaining arms; the opposite arm leaves the ground as the star
