SEARCH FOR A COLLABORATOR FOR FUND MANAGEMENT

Dear Friend,

I hope this message finds you in good health. My name is Mr. Hassane MAMAN, and I am writing to you regarding a very confidential and lucrative business opportunity.

I am a senior financial consultant working with one of the leading banks in West Africa. During the course of my work, I discovered an abandoned account belonging to a deceased foreign contractor who worked with our government on various infrastructure projects.

The account contains the sum of USD $8.5 Million (Eight Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) which has been dormant for over 7 years. According to our banking laws, if this money is not claimed within the next few months, it will be transferred to the government treasury as unclaimed funds.

I am seeking a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner who can assist me in transferring this fund to a safe account overseas. As the deceased contractor has no known next of kin, I propose that you present yourself as his business partner to claim this inheritance.

THE BENEFITS TO YOU:
- 40% of the total sum ($3.4 Million) will be your share
- 50% will be my share for providing the information and facilitating the transfer
- 10% will be set aside for any expenses that may arise during the process

This transaction is 100% risk-free and legal. I have all the necessary documents and connections within the bank to ensure smooth processing. All I need from you is your commitment and cooperation.

If you are interested in this opportunity, please reply to my private email address: hassanemaman1982@gmail.com with the following information:

1. Your full name and address
2. Your direct telephone number
3. Your occupation
4. A copy of your identification

Upon receipt of your response, I will provide you with more details about the procedure and the documents required to proceed.

Please treat this matter with utmost confidentiality as my job and reputation depend on it.

I look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,
Mr. Hassane MAMAN
