Good morning team — I wanted to share that several regulars have been asking about a simple how-to session on setting up raised garden beds before spring arrives. We have a few demo kits in the back, and I think this could be a useful way to show them in action. Could you let me know if Saturday afternoon works for scheduling a short workshop and what support we might have for signage Thanks for considering this idea.

Appreciate the suggestion Alex — Saturday afternoon is open on our calendar. We can reserve the area near the seed display and set aside the demo kits you mentioned. I’ll coordinate with the front-end crew to help guide guests to the space and will arrange a simple handout with step-by-step instructions.

Sharing this plan with you — if timing allows, it might be helpful to highlight the workshop on our local social channels. A short post describing the raised bed setup and the time window could draw in more neighbors who have been planning their spring gardens.

This fits nicely with our seasonal content. I’ll draft a brief announcement for social and include a photo from last year’s garden aisle reset. As long as details stay the same, we can have the post live by Thursday morning and give folks enough notice. Please confirm the final start time and any materials you want mentioned, and I’ll update the copy accordingly.

Thanks everyone for moving this forward — let’s set the workshop for 2:00–3:00 PM on Saturday. I’ll prepare a quick demonstration outline and make sure the demo kits are ready beforehand. I appreciate the teamwork in pulling this together on short notice.
