Hello David,

My name is Alex Johnson and I am a member of the Operations Department at Company Personal Wealth. I will be assisting with the request your advisor submitted for us to initiate a transfer of 1064 AMZN shares from your Fidelity account ending in 0413 to your Company Individual account.

This email is to inform you I sent you the forms required to initiate the transfer via DocuSign. Please check your email inbox for the DocuSign notification and complete it at your earliest convenience. Once signed, I will send it to our custodian, Pershing, for processing and the funds should arrive within 5-7 business days.

I will follow up with Fidelity to ensure the request is in good order and will let you know if anything additional is needed. If you don't hear from me, that means everything is moving forward, and I will let you know once the transfer is complete.

Please let me know if you have any questions. I hope you have a great rest of your day.

Thank you,

Alex Johnson  |   Spec Client Service
