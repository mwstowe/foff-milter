Good morning team — I wanted to share that the new batch of raised garden beds has arrived ahead of schedule this week. At the moment, all pallets are staged near the back entrance. Could you let me know which aisles we’ll be using for the display so we can organize signage and pricing cards accordingly A few customers have already asked about setup tips, so I’d like to have the area ready for them soon. Thanks in advance for the quick guidance.

Thanks Jordan for the heads up — the raised beds will go along the main seasonal run next to the soil and mulch section. We’ll reserve the first two bays on the right side. I’ll have the morning crew clear the space and bring over the display racks. Once everything is in place, I’ll stop by to review the layout with you and confirm the final labels.

Appreciate the update Riley — when the display is ready, please capture a couple of photos for our weekly in-store highlights. We’re putting together a short feature on early garden projects and this setup would be a great example for other locations to reference.

Will do — we should have the display finalized by early afternoon. Once the team finishes the layout, I’ll gather a few clear photos from different angles and include a short note on which accessories are merchandised nearby. I’ll send everything over so you can select what works best for the highlight piece.

Appreciate everyone coordinating on this — I’ll be available near the seasonal aisle when the photos are taken in case any additional details are needed. Looking forward to seeing how the feature turns out.
