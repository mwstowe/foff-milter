ees are angiosperms, and most species are almost entirely interfertile. This includes grapefruits, lemons, limes, oranges, and many citrus hybrids. As the interfertility of oranges and other citrus has produced numerous hybrids and cultivars, and bud mutations have also been selected, citrus taxonomy has proven difficult.

The sweet orange, Citrus x sinensis, is not a wild fruit, but arose in domestication in East Asia. It originated in a region encompassing Southern China, Northeast India and Myanmar. The fruit was created as a cross between a non-pure mandarin orange and a hybrid pomelo that had a substantial mandarin component. Since its chloroplast DNA is that of pomelo, it was likely the hybrid pomelo, perhaps a pomelo BC1 backcross, that was the maternal parent of the first orange. Based on genomic analysis, the relative proportions of the ancestral species in the sweet orange are approximately 42% pomelo and 58% mandarin. All varieties of the sweet orange descend from this prototype cross, differing only by mutations selected for during agricultural propagation Sweet oranges have a distinct origin from the bitter orange, which arose independently, perhaps in the wild, from a cross between pure mandarin and pomelo parents.

Sweet oranges have in turn given rise to many further hybrids including the grapefruit, which arose from a sweet orange x pomelo backcross.

<br />
Researchers say about 400 synthetic chemicals may be floating around in your body right now.<br />
<br />
In fact...<br />
<br />
The chronic joint pain, cramping or swelling in your legs and feet are a sign of high levels of toxicity in your blood.<br />
<br />
And they say the only way to <i><u>remove these toxins safely is through the feet.</u></i><br />
<br />
Luckily scientists discovered a special kind of <a href="http://trendspire.cyou/zbN480JBmU7Seg3HV9nTo1R9K6RkdqriOLvgRlNERhCY0YHx6w" http:="" microsoft.com="" rel="sponsored" target="blank"><b>&quot;wood vinegar&quot; </b></a>that draws out toxins from your body while you sleep...<br />
